# EmpathyApp

Empathy Bytes is a Georgia Tech VIP project that aims to create a digital archive of a Georgia Tech community of choice. For the Fall 2020 semester our community of choice was the maker space communities. Members of the Empathy Bytes VIP team interviewed those from the Invention Studio and The Hive makerspaces. This aspect of the project was to make a VR/AR app that showcased the makerspaces. This semester we were able to complete the framework of the app and have pages for a podcast section, and about us section, and a section about our interviews which we made using Swift. The files can be found in the appEB folder. The qualities of the Empathy Bytes app is that it is a condensed version of the Empathy Bytes website so that it makes accessing content such as podcasts or blod posts easier. However, the major benefit of the app is that it will contain a VR video of the Invention Studio or The Hive makerspaces (in the format of a YouTube 360 video) that adds a visual component to the website. In this manner, viewers can be immersed into the world of makerspaces as described by the podcasts and interviews. Currently, we do not have the VR component of the app and implementing that component is the next goal for the app.
